# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains small Python projects that I build while learning and practicing Python.

Each project focuses on understanding core concepts by building simple, working programs instead of just writing theory-based code.

## What this repository includes
- Beginner-friendly Python mini projects
- Small utilities and scripts
- Practice-based learning projects

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to track my progress, improve my problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in Python through hands-on projects.

## How this repository is structured
- Each mini project is stored in its own folder
- Every folder contains the Python file(s) related to that project
- Some projects may include a small README explaining how they work

## Tech used
- Python 3

## Note
These projects are part of my learning journey and will be updated or improved as I learn more.
